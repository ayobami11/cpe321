1. Explain the relationship between Java and C++.

    Java and C++ are both **object-oriented programming languages**. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm which relies on the concept of classes and objects to structure a software program into simple, reusable parts (or, classes), which are then used to create individual instances of objects. This means both languages utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. List and explain 5 methods of doing software development.

    These are basically software development techniques like waterfall, agile, Rapid Application Development. Refer to the last note he sent last class. The answers are there.

4.
    Solve quadratic equations in Java and C++ using common line method.

    I don't know what he means by common line method but I wrote a solution that uses the quadratic formula.

    - [C++](./assignment1/quadraticCalculator.cpp)
    - [Java](./QuadraticCalculator.java)

5. With respect to SDT, define technique.

    This is the definition of software development technique.

    With respect to SDT, a technique refers to the strategies and processes that developers follow in creating and managing software in order to perform tasks effectively and efficiently.
